# Are There Economic Benefits to Superfund Site Cleanup? 2021

For this project, we wanted to find out how has the 1980 establishment of the Superfund affected pollution in the surrounding areas? What have been the economic impacts for surrounding communities? 

The potential negative economic ramifications not only affect individuals directly impacted, but possibly generations to come. Furthermore, some of these ramifications may also hinder equal opportunity for health, wealth, and the pursuit of happiness since it affects disproportionately marginalized communities. 

We expected to see an overall reduction in pollution; however, what was still unclear was how those reductions have affected some economic factors. We focused specifically on outcome variables, such as home ownership, and unemployment.
